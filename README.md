# scriptable-widgets-traveller
A traveller's widget that helps you figure out what things really cost.

The widget displays the amounts set in the configuration in the foreign currency, along with the calculated amount in your own currency.

You can also tap on the widget to bring up an alert asking you to enter an amount. That amount, along with the calculated equivalent in your own currency is then displayed in the lower part of the widget.

##Installation

Download Traveller.js and place it in the "Scriptable" directory in your iCloud Drive (or copy the source code into a new Scriptable script).
